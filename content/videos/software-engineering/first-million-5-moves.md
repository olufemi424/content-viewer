# YouTube Script: What I Learned Earning My First $1,000,000 in As A Software Engineer (5 Moves)

## Hook (0:00–0:25)
"I earned my first $1,000,000 by creating software, but it didn’t happen quickly or by luck. It took me six years, and I used a clear plan to do it. In this video, I will tell you the five most important things that helped me make that money—plus I’ll share how I’d do it even faster if I started again."

## Creds in 1 Breath (0:25–0:40)
"Quick context: salaried dev → tech lead/consultant → productized services → micro‑SaaS/licensing. Mix of salary, freelance retainers, rev‑share, and product revenue."

---

## Lesson 1 — Solve Business Problems, Not Tickets (0:40–2:00)
- Code is a tool; outcomes pay.
- Ask: What revenue/cost/risk metric does this change? Who cares enough to fund it?
- Translate features to business impact in plain language.
- Deliverables that sold: before/after metrics, dashboards, and short Looms showing the win.

Example: Replaced nightly batch with event pipeline → refunds down 18% → support time down 35% → green light for a retainer.

---

## Lesson 2 — Build a Compound Skill Stack (2:00–3:10)
- T‑shaped: strong core (e.g., backend) + working knowledge (frontend, cloud, data, AI).
- Add “unfair” multipliers: writing, estimation, negotiation, and calm stakeholder comms.
- Learn one layer above and below your main stack (app ↔ infra, data ↔ product).

Rule of thumb: 70% build, 20% learn, 10% teach (write posts, talks, OSS). Teaching creates deal flow.

---

## Lesson 3 — Ship Fast, Close Feedback Loops (3:10–4:10)
- Weekly demo cadence beats perfect specs.
- Small, reversible releases; instrument everything (logs, metrics, user events).
- Use thin vertical slices: UI → API → DB → deploy on day 3, not week 3.

Outcome: Faster feedback → fewer wrong turns → happier buyers → repeat work.

---

## Lesson 4 — Multiple Monetization Lanes (4:10–5:10)
- Salary/contract, consulting retainers, productized services, micro‑SaaS, licensing, training.
- Price for outcomes: flat + success fee, or tiered packages (Core/Pro/Scale).
- Keep IP: reusable components, internal libraries, templates → turn into products.

Rule: Use client work to fund assets that earn while you sleep.

---

## Lesson 5 — Systems Beat Motivation (5:10–6:10)
- Calendar blocks: deep work, sales, delivery, learning, content.
- Pipeline tracker: leads → discovery → proposal → closed → delivered → case study.
- Templates: proposals, SOWs, onboarding checklists, postmortems.
- Weekly review: revenue by lane, win/loss reasons, next bets.

System > mood. That’s how you survive six years without burning out.

## If I Had to Do It Again Faster — The 5 Moves (6:10–8:30)
1) Pick a pain‑niche + outcome offer (2 weeks)
   - Example: “Reduce checkout failures 30% in 60 days for Shopify Plus.” Clear buyer, clear metric.

2) Build 3 proof assets in 30 days
   - A live demo, a tiny OSS repo, and one tight case study with numbers.

3) Turn distribution into a habit (8 weeks, ongoing)
   - 2 posts/week (LinkedIn/X), 1 monthly talk, 1 longform write‑up/quarter. Show charts, not adjectives.

4) Price like a business, not a dev
   - Packages with outcomes, retainers for ops, success fees for upside. Review pricing every quarter.

5) Productize the repeats (quarterly)
   - Convert repeated client work into a micro‑SaaS, CLI, or paid template. License to teams you already helped.

Bonus: Reinvest 30–50% into learning, tooling, and content that builds the moat.

---

## Common Traps to Avoid (8:30–9:20)
- Infinite refactors no user asked for.
- Quoting hours instead of outcomes.
- Saying yes to everything; protect focus.
- No metrics → no story → no premium pricing.

---

## Closing (9:20–10:00)
"Six years taught me this: stack skills, solve real pains, ship weekly, and let systems compound. If you want the offer/case‑study templates I use, comment 'TEMPLATES' and I’ll drop them in the next video. Create assets. Create leverage. See you next week."
