## 1) Prioritize Tasks Using the Eisenhower Matrix (0:45–2:30)
"First up: The Eisenhower Matrix. It’s a simple yet powerful tool that helps you decide what’s truly important. Imagine four boxes:

- Urgent & Important: Do these tasks now (like meeting a tight deadline).
- Important but Not Urgent: Schedule these (like working on your personal growth).
- Urgent but Not Important: Delegate (think of routine emails).
- Neither: Eliminate these time-wasters.

Example: A marketing manager focuses on strategic planning (important) while delegating daily social media posts. The key? Spend most of your time in the ‘important but not urgent’ box—that’s where growth happens."

## 2) Implement the Pomodoro Technique (2:30–4:00)
"Feeling overwhelmed? Try the Pomodoro Technique. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four ‘Pomodoros,’ take a longer 15-minute break.

Example: A student studying for finals uses Pomodoros to stay sharp. This method boosts focus, reduces burnout, and keeps procrastination in check. Give it a shot—you’ll be amazed at your productivity!"

## 3) Set SMART Goals (4:00–5:30)
"Ever feel like you’re busy but not getting anywhere? That’s because your goals aren’t SMART:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

Example: Instead of saying, ‘I want to get fit,’ set a goal like, ‘I will jog 3 miles, four times a week, for the next 3 months.’ This clarity makes all the difference."

## 4) Batch Similar Tasks Together (5:30–7:00)
"Jumping between tasks is a productivity killer. Enter task batching. Group similar activities together to maintain focus.

Example: An entrepreneur schedules all client calls on Mondays and handles admin tasks on Fridays. This minimizes ‘task-switching fatigue’ and keeps your brain in the zone."

## 5) Reflect and Review Regularly (7:00–8:30)
"Lastly, the secret sauce: Weekly Reviews. Take 15 minutes every week to reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and how to improve.

Example: A software developer reviews their progress every Friday, pinpointing time drains. This habit helps you adjust and optimize continuously."

## Closing Summary (8:30–9:30)
"So, to recap:
1. Prioritize with the Eisenhower Matrix
2. Use the Pomodoro Technique
3. Set SMART goals
4. Batch similar tasks
5. Reflect weekly

Master these, and you’ll reclaim your time like never before!"
