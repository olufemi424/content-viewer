## 0) Summary One-Liner
- Promise: A simple, repeatable way to build self-belief you can actually feel this week.
- Big idea: Confidence compounds when you act in alignment with who you say you are — JUST BE.
- For: Anyone stuck overthinking, stalled, or second‑guessing their path.

## 1) Hook (0:00–0:20)
- Opening line: "Whatever you aspire to be… just be — today."
- Tease the payoff: "I’ll give you three principles and a tiny daily protocol to install real confidence in 7 days."
- Visual note: Title card “JUST BE” + quick montage of micro‑actions (writing, gym, code commit).

## 2) Establish Authority (0:20–0:35)
- Credibility beats (pick 1–2):
  - Helped teams ship under pressure; built habits that survived crunch cycles.
  - Mentored folks from ‘stuck’ to shipping weekly — momentum over motivation.
- Why you, why now: Clear, simple systems beat hype; we’ll use ones that survive busy weeks.

## 3) Why It Matters (0:35–0:55)
- Stakes: Waiting for motivation kills dreams; identity formed by action makes them inevitable.
- Desired outcome: You’ll leave with a 10‑minute daily protocol that builds visible self‑trust.
- Context in 1 line: Confidence isn’t a mood — it’s evidence you generate through consistent action.

## 4) Roadmap (0:55–1:10)
- "We’ll cover:" 1) Identity > Outcome, 2) Persistence > Perfection, 3) Environment > Willpower.
- Retention cue: "Stick around for a printable ‘JUST BE’ checklist at the end."

## 5) Core Section Loop (repeat 3 times)

### Principle 1: Identity > Outcome
- Story / Proof: Goals feel far; identities live now. Writers write. Builders build. Athletes train.
- Philosophy / Insight: Don’t chase ‘someday’; embody ‘I am the kind of person who…’ and prove it today.
- Application / Tactics:
  - Identity sentence: “I am a <role> who <daily action> at <time>.”
  - Pick a 10‑minute action you can’t fail: 150 words, 10 pushups, 1 code commit, 1 outreach.
- Actionable Framework
  1. Write the identity sentence.
  2. Define the smallest daily action (≤10 minutes).
  3. Do it at the same time each day for 7 days.
- Visual / Assets
  - On‑screen text: “Identity > Outcome”
  - B‑roll: 10‑minute timer, quick micro‑wins.
- Transition: "Identity is installed by reps — now make it resilient."

### Principle 2: Persistence > Perfection
- Story / Proof: Most quit on day 3–4 — not from failure, from friction.
- Philosophy / Insight: Consistency beats intensity; imperfect reps compound.
- Application / Tactics:
  - Set a floor, not a ceiling: do the floor daily; the rest is bonus.
  - Use streak protection: if you miss, do a 2‑minute recovery rep the next day.
- Actionable Framework
  1. Define the floor (e.g., 100 words / 2 minutes / 1 set).
  2. Track streaks visibly (calendar or habit app).
  3. If missed: recovery rep within 24 hours.
- Visual / Assets
  - On‑screen: “Persistence > Perfection”
  - B‑roll: Marking a calendar; short recovery set.
- Transition: "Now make the environment make it easy."

### Principle 3: Environment > Willpower
- Story / Proof: Future you is unreliable; present you needs scaffolding.
- Philosophy / Insight: Design beats discipline. Reduce friction, increase cues.
- Application / Tactics:
  - Put tools in sight: shoes by door, editor open with a stub file, notebook on desk.
  - Social leverage: share your tiny protocol with one person; send a daily check emoji.
- Actionable Framework
  1. Stage your environment each evening for tomorrow’s 10‑minute action.
  2. Use a single visible tracker (sticky notes / whiteboard / app).
  3. Micro‑community: one accountability partner, shared streak screenshot.
- Visual / Assets
  - On‑screen: “Environment > Willpower”
  - B‑roll: Laying out tools; DM check‑in.
- Transition: "Let’s synthesize into your ‘JUST BE’ daily protocol."

## 6) Synthesis / Big Takeaways
- Your identity is a verb — do it daily for 10 minutes.
- Don’t break the chain; if you do, recovery rep within 24 hours.
- Make the action obvious and easy; let the room do half the work.

## 7) CTA (Call to Action)
- Primary CTA: Comment your 10‑minute identity action; I’ll hold you accountable for 7 days.
- Secondary CTA: Download the ‘JUST BE’ checklist (link) and stick it on your wall.
- Engagement question: What identity sentence are you installing this week?

## 8) Outro (0:10–0:20)
- Sign‑off line: "JUST BE the person who does the thing — see you tomorrow."
- Next‑episode tease: "We’ll stack this with a 3‑block focus system for deep work."
