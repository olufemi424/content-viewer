## 1st Version

Hello Guys,

Today I want to talk about something that trips up a lot of new software engineers - and honestly, even some experienced ones.

The Problem

You're learning to code. You're watching tutorials, building projects, but you're not sure if you're actually getting better. Sound familiar?

Here's the thing: most people focus on the wrong metrics. They count how many tutorials they've watched or how many hours they've spent coding. But that's not what matters.

What Actually Matters

The real progress happens when you can solve problems you couldn't solve before. When you can look at code and understand what it does - even if you didn't write it. When you can break down a big problem into smaller pieces.

Here's a simple test: Can you explain what your code does to someone else? If you can't, you probably don't fully understand it yet.

My Advice

Stop counting hours. Start counting problems solved. Build something that solves a real problem - even if it's small. That's where the real learning happens.

In the next video, I'll share the exact framework I use to break down complex problems. It's saved me hundreds of hours.

See you then.

Hello Guys

Most new developers are measuring the wrong thing.

You're tracking hours spent coding. Tutorials watched. Projects started.

But here's what actually matters: Can you solve problems you couldn't solve yesterday?

The Real Test

Can you explain your code to someone else? If not, you don't fully understand it yet.

Stop counting hours. Start counting problems solved.

Build something that solves a real problem - even if it's tiny. That's where real learning happens.

Next video: I'll share the exact framework I use to break down complex problems. It's saved me hundreds of hours.

See you then.
