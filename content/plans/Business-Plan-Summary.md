## Overview
As a senior software developer with a 9-5 job, you aim to start a scalable business in 2025 that leverages your expertise in Vue.js, Node.js, and AWS, while fitting your limited time and risk tolerance. Past ventures (Instagram, YouTube, real estate, crypto) inform a strategy focusing on low-cost, high-potential ideas.

## Proposed Business Ideas

2. **YouTube Channel**: Expand your tech-focused YouTube channel with tutorials and career advice. Monetize through ads ($3–$7/1,000 views) and sponsorships. Low startup cost.
3. **Crypto Education Platform**: Offer courses on crypto investing, leveraging your portfolio experience. Use Teachable for hosting, charging $50–$200/course. Market growth: 20% CAGR.
4. **Software Consulting**: Provide niche consulting in web technologies and DevOps for startups. Charge $100–$200/hour. Market growth: 7% CAGR.
5. **E-commerce Digital Products**: Sell coding templates and tech e-books via Shopify or Gumroad. Price at $10–$50. Market growth: 12% CAGR.

## Next Steps
- **Prioritize**: Start with YouTube or consulting for low risk and quick traction.
- **Test**: Launch MVPs (e.g., 5 videos, 3 digital products) and gather feedback via X or LinkedIn.
- **Scale**: Reinvest profits to enhance offerings and explore SaaS for long-term growth.
