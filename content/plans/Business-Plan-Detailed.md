## 1) Objectives (2025)
- Revenue: $2k/mo by Q2, $5k/mo by Q4 (diversified)
- Time: ≤10 hrs/week average (batching + automation)
- Risk: Low upfront cost; reversible steps; validate early
- Focus: Ship quickly, measure, iterate; keep scope tight

## 2) Portfolio Strategy
- Core engine: YouTube channel (distribution + trust)
- Cashflow bridge: Consulting (high-margin, flexible)
- Scalable bets:
  - Digital products (templates, guides) → near-term
  - Crypto education (course/newsletter) → opportunistic
  - SaaS (freelancer invoicing MVP) → medium-term

## 3) Offers (V1 scope)
- Consulting: API integration, cloud cost reduction, CI/CD hardening
  - Packaging: 5-hr “API fast-track” ($750), 10-hr “DevOps tune-up” ($1,500)
  - Lead magnets: free 30-min diagnostic, before/after checklists
- Digital products:
  - “Node.js API Starter Kit” (repo + docs + scripts): $39
  - “CI/CD Speedup Playbook” (checklist + example pipelines): $29
  - Bundle: $59 (save 25%)
- YouTube:
  - Cadence: 1 video/week (8–10 min, tutorial/case study)
  - CTA: consulting diagnostic + product bundle
- Crypto education (conditional on market interest):
  - “Crypto Risk-Managed Starter” mini-course (1h): $49
  - Newsletter pilot: free → $10/mo if 1k+ free subs show interest
- SaaS (freelancer invoicing MVP):
  - Narrow scope: invoice creation, payment tracking, reminders
  - Validation: landing + waitlist; build with 5 alpha users

## 4) Quarterly Plan
- Q1 (Set foundation + first sales)
  - Publish 8 videos (weekly): API, CI/CD, cost optimization, case studies
  - Launch consulting packages + booking form
  - Ship 2 digital products + bundle
  - Collect 3–5 testimonials (consulting or product users)
- Q2 (Scale distribution + refine offers)
  - Maintain weekly video cadence
  - Add 1–2 new products; run first small promotion
  - Explore crypto mini-course (only if organic interest ≥ threshold)
  - Start SaaS discovery: interviews (5–10 freelancers)
- Q3 (Build SaaS MVP if validated)
  - Waitlist → 5 alpha users; ship invoice → payment → reminder loop
  - Add “pro” tier to products (templates + 1h workshop replay)
  - Target 1–2 consulting retainers (light hours)
- Q4 (Optimize + compound)
  - Double down on highest ROI channel/offers
  - Automate ops (templates, email flows, basic CRM)
  - Prep 2026 roadmap based on data

## 5) KPIs (monthly targets)
- YouTube: +500 subs, 2–3% CTR on end-CTAs
- Consulting: 4–8 discovery calls, 2–3 paid engagements
- Products: 50–100 unit sales, bundle attach ≥ 30%
- Email list: +300 net subs; open rate ≥ 35%
- SaaS (if running): 5 alpha → 10–20 waitlist conversions

## 6) Channels & Assets
- Distribution: YouTube (long), X/LinkedIn (clips), email (weekly)
- Pages: simple landing per offer (clear promise, proof, 1 CTA)
- Proof: testimonials, benchmarks (latency, CI time, cost deltas)
- Automation: email welcome + 2 follow-ups; booking + calendar integration

## 7) Content Calendar (first 8 videos)
1. Cut CI from 45m → 8m (step-by-step, real config)
2. API reliability: idempotency + retries + backpressure
3. Cloud cost down 25–30% without losing reliability
4. Core Web Vitals: pragmatic wins for enterprise UIs
5. Observability: p95 < 120ms with useful dashboards
6. DevEx: templates and scripts that save hours weekly
7. API starter kit walkthrough (what’s included)
8. Consulting diagnostic: what we check in 30 minutes

## 8) Execution Playbooks
- Consulting intake
  - Form → 30-min call → short proposal (scope, price, 1–2 outcomes)
  - Deliverable-first mindset; set a small win within first 48 hours
- Product ship
  - Define outcome → ship smallest useful version → add worksheet → release notes
  - Bundle policy: +20–40% value; guarantee 14 days
- YouTube workflow
  - Outline → record in one session → minimal edits → strong CTA
  - Recut key moments into 30–60s clips for X/LinkedIn

## 9) Budget (lean)
- Tools: domain, email, hosting, video editor (free/cheap) → < $50/mo
- Spend rules: only if it cuts time >1 hr/wk or directly boosts conversion
- Reserve: small buffer for promos or design polish when proven

## 10) Risks & Mitigations
- Time slip → batch content + fixed scope; “good enough + shipped”
- Low conversions → sharpen offer, stronger proof, simpler CTA
- Audience growth slow → collaborate, comments as research, SEO basics
- SaaS scope creep → lock MVP to invoice/payment/reminders only
- Crypto volatility → opportunistic only; keep it optional

## 11) Decision Rules (focus filter)
- Prioritize: activities tied to revenue within 30–60 days
- Kill: ideas without traction after 2–3 attempts unless strategic
- Bet sizing: tiny experiments first; scale only with proof (metrics/testimonials)

## 12) Roadmap Snapshot (at a glance)
- Now (0–4 weeks): 2 products, consulting live, 4 videos, email welcome flow
- Next (4–12 weeks): 4 more videos, 1–2 products, first promo, 3 testimonials
- Later (12+ weeks): SaaS validation + alpha, refine best-selling offers

## 13) Simple Stack
- Site/pages: your current content viewer + simple hosted pages
- Payments: Gumroad/Stripe (products), Calendly + Stripe (consulting)
- Email: simple ESP (welcome + 2 follow-ups + weekly digest)
- Tracking: basic link tracking + spreadsheet dashboard (KPIs above)
