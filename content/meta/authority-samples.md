## How to use
- Drop one or two lines under “Establish Authority” and one “Why you, why now” sentence.
- Keep it specific, verifiable, and outcome-focused. One strong line is better than five vague ones.

## Quick picks (generic)
- Former senior engineer who shipped production systems used by millions.
- Led cross‑functional teams to deliver projects on time and under budget.
- Built and scaled services from zero to thousands of daily users.
- Designed systems that cut cloud costs by double‑digit percentages without losing performance.
- Helped junior devs grow into senior roles through code reviews and mentoring.
- Spoke at meetups and internal tech talks on practical engineering patterns.
- Contributed to open source, including fixes used by popular libraries.
- Shipped weekly content that developers actually use at work.

## Software engineering (general)
- Ex‑enterprise engineer: shipped features to 500k+ monthly users across 3 business lines.
- Drove CI/CD modernization: reduced deploy time from 45 minutes to under 8 minutes.
- Eliminated flaky tests (200+), increasing pipeline reliability from 82% to 98%.
- Reduced infra cost by ~30% via right‑sizing and caching strategies.
- Built internal tooling adopted by 6 teams, saving hours per developer weekly.
- Ran incident postmortems and wrote guardrails that prevented repeat outages.
- Migrated legacy monolith modules to modular boundaries without downtime.

## Frontend engineering
- Led frontend rewrites that improved Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1).
- Implemented design systems used across multiple products with zero regressions.
- Cut bundle size by 40% using code‑splitting and asset budgets.
- Built accessible components (WCAG 2.1 AA) with keyboard and screen reader support.
- Drove UI experiments that lifted conversion 8–12% on high‑traffic flows.
- Launched SSR/ISR for faster first paint and better SEO on content pages.

## Backend engineering
- Designed APIs serving thousands of RPS with p95 < 120ms.
- Deployed idempotent, observable workflows with dead‑letter recovery.
- Introduced queues and backpressure to stabilize peak traffic events.
- Implemented database migrations and indexing strategies that scaled cleanly.
- Hardened services with rate limits, authz, and audit logging.
- Wrote SLOs, dashboards, and runbooks that shortened MTTR significantly.

## AI/ML and agents
- Productionized LLM features with retrieval, schema‑constrained outputs, and verifiers.
- Reduced hallucinations by adding retrieval + verification loops.
- Tuned cost/latency via caching, smaller models for simple tasks, and seeds.
- Built multi‑step agent flows: plan → tools → verify → revise.
- Shipped guardrails and red‑team checks for safer generations.
- Delivered measurable impact (tickets closed faster, support deflection, or analyst throughput).

## Creator business / digital products
- Launched digital products with clear outcomes and refund policies that increased trust.
- Built branded pages that convert: focused headline, proof, and one CTA.
- Ran small pilots to collect testimonials and iterate quickly.
- Used bundles and ladders to lift average order value and LTV.
- Automated email follow‑ups that drove post‑launch sales.
- Diversified products (templates, guides, mini‑courses) to reduce risk.

## Leadership, hiring, mentorship
- Interviewed and hired engineers across levels; built high‑trust teams.
- Mentored juniors to ship confidently and write maintainable code.
- Instituted code review guidelines that sped up merge time without lowering quality.
- Set roadmap priorities by impact and risk, not loudest voice.
- Facilitated postmortems that improved ownership rather than blame.
- Advocated for accessibility, documentation, and sustainable pace.

## Open source & community
- Maintainer/contributor to libraries used by thousands of developers.
- Wrote docs and examples that reduced GitHub issues for new users.
- Triaged bugs, added tests, and shipped patch releases.
- Spoke at community meetups and shared practical lessons from production.
- Organized contribution sprints to onboard first‑time contributors.
- Reviewed PRs with a focus on clarity, tests, and long‑term maintenance.

## Education, speaking, media
- Taught internal workshops on testing, observability, or performance.
- Delivered talks at meetups about real‑world architecture tradeoffs.
- Wrote guides that engineers used to ship features the same day.
- Appeared on podcasts/videos discussing practical engineering patterns.
- Created templates/checklists teams adopted in their day‑to‑day.
- Built repeatable curriculum for onboarding and skill leveling.

## Proof‑by‑metrics snippets (paste‑ready)
- “Reduced page load time by 42% and increased conversion by 9%.”
- “Cut CI time from 45m → 8m; deploys went from weekly to multiple times daily.”
- “Brought p95 latency from 480ms → 110ms during peak traffic.”
- “Lowered cloud spend by ~28% while improving reliability (99.95%→99.98%).”
- “Onboarded 6 junior devs to ship PRs within their first week.”
- “Improved test pass rate from 82% to 98% and stabilized nightly builds.”

## ‘Why you, why now’ (paste‑ready)
- “I’ve shipped this in production and will show you exactly what works.”
- “The market changed—this approach balances speed, cost, and reliability today.”
- “I’ll skip fluff and give you steps you can implement this week.”
- “You’ll leave with a checklist—no theory, just what survives prod.”
