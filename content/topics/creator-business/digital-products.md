## 0) Summary One-Liner
- Promise: Launch a branded page and your first digital product in 7 days.
- Big idea: Run a tight loop—platform → page → product → monetization → iteration.
- For: Creators/educators starting from zero or moving off marketplaces.

## 1) Hook (0:00–0:20)
- Opening line: "Build a simple branded page and sell your first digital product this week."
- Tease the payoff: "Pick a platform, ship a page, publish a product, turn on payments."

## 2) Why It Matters (0:20–0:55)
- Stakes: If you stay on marketplaces only, you rent audience and margin. Own your page, own your list, own your pricing.
- Desired outcome: A clean, mobile-first page that converts first dollars and becomes your compounding engine.
- Context: Online course and digital product demand keeps growing; low overhead, high leverage when paired with email and SEO.

## 3) Roadmap (0:55–1:10)
- We'll cover: 1) Choose a platform, 2) Build your branded page, 3) Create a minimum-viable product, 4) Monetize and diversify, 5) Launch and iterate.
- Retention cue: Stick around for appendices with a platform comparison and product-type ideas.

## 4) Core Steps (repeatable loop)

### Step 1: Choose a Platform (time-to-first-sale optimized)
- Story / Proof: Platforms trade off built-in traffic vs. control. Udemy brings audience but takes margin; Teachable/Kajabi/Podia give control and bundling; Wix gives flexibility if you need a general site.
- Philosophy / Insight: Optimize for time-to-first-sale, not perfection. You can migrate later—shipping beats stalling.
- Application / Tactics (this week): Decide in 15 minutes using rules of thumb:
  - If you want built-in demand and don't mind rev-share → Udemy.
  - If you want your own school and funnels → Teachable or Kajabi.
  - If you want affordable, simple, multiple product types → Podia or Thinkific.
  - If you need a general website with course add-ons → Wix.
- Actionable Framework:
  1) List must-haves: payments, coupons, email capture, custom domain.
  2) Pick 1 platform from Appendix A.
  3) Connect a domain (or subdomain like learn.yoursite.com).
  4) Turn on payments (Stripe/PayPal).
  5) Create a blank product and draft pricing.
- Transition: With the platform ready, build a page that converts.

### Step 2: Build Your Branded Page (ship v1 fast)
- Story / Proof: Clean, mobile-first pages with 1 CTA convert best. Consistency (colors, bio, headshot) builds trust.
- Philosophy / Insight: Clarity > clever. Make the value obvious, above the fold.
- Application / Tactics (this week): Page sections in order:
  - Headline (promise + time): "Master X in 30 days without Y."
  - Subhead (who it's for): "For creators who want Z."
  - Outcome bullets (3–5): measurable results and specifics.
  - Hero CTA: "Enroll now" or "Buy the template."
  - Authority strip: logo row, credentials, 1–2 proofs.
  - Detailed description: what’s inside, format, time commitment.
  - Social proof: 3 short testimonials (or "pilot cohort" slots).
  - FAQ: objections (time, skill level, refund).
  - Final CTA.
- Actionable Framework:
  1) Pick 1 color palette, 1 font pair. Reuse across assets.
  2) Write headline/subhead/CTA in plain language.
  3) Add a short bio and a clean headshot.
  4) Add at least 1 testimonial (or a guarantee if you have none).
  5) Test on mobile and fix spacing/contrast.
- Transition: Now give the page something valuable to sell.

### Step 3: Create a Minimum-Viable Product (MVP)
- Story / Proof: Short, outcome-first products ship faster and sell more than sprawling courses.
- Philosophy / Insight: Build the smallest version, get it in someone’s hands this week, rebuild from feedback.
- Application / Tactics (pick one MVP):
  - Mini-course: 3 lessons × 6–8 minutes, captions, 1 worksheet.
  - Guide/ebook: 10–15 pages, 1 checklist, 1 template.
  - Template/asset: 1 spreadsheet or 1 pack of 10 prompts/presets.
- Actionable Framework:
  1) Define 1 outcome ("By Friday you will …").
  2) Outline 3 modules or 3 parts only.
  3) Record/write in a single sitting; imperfect is fine.
  4) Add a simple worksheet or template.
  5) Upload, set price, publish as “beta”.
- Transition: With a sellable MVP, turn on monetization levers.

### Step 4: Monetize and Diversify (value ladder)
- Story / Proof: Pricing ladders and bundles increase AOV and LTV.
- Philosophy / Insight: Start low to validate; ascend with proof and scope.
- Application / Tactics:
  - Pricing: free lead magnet → $29–$49 MVP → $99+ expanded course → membership or bundle.
  - Offers: add a workbook, templates, or community for +20–40% bundle value.
  - Channels: email, social teasers, affiliates, SEO pages.
- Actionable Framework:
  1) Set an initial price (under $50) to remove friction.
  2) Create one bundle (product + template at 20% off).
  3) Add a money-back guarantee (7–14 days).
  4) Create a basic email follow-up (3 emails: welcome, value, offer).
  5) Add 1 partner/affiliate with tracked link.
- Transition: Ship, get signal, iterate.

### Step 5: Launch and Iterate (feedback loops)
- Story / Proof: Small pilots yield faster testimonials and direction.
- Philosophy / Insight: Iteration beats ideation. Feedback compounds.
- Application / Tactics:
  - Soft launch to 20–50 people (list, DMs, close followers).
  - Ask for 3 short testimonials; add them to the page.
  - Track conversion rate, refund rate, and email opt-ins.
- Actionable Framework:
  1) Send a 3-email launch sequence.
  2) Offer a limited early-bird price or bonus for 72 hours.
  3) Collect feedback via 3-question survey.
  4) Ship v1.1 within 2 weeks (fill the biggest gap).
  5) Plan a public relaunch with updated proof.

## 6) Synthesis / Big Takeaways
- Getting started: Validate the outcome, not perfection—ship the smallest viable product.
- Page design: Clarity, proof, single CTA. Mobile-first.
- Monetization: Use a ladder and bundles; iterate based on real data.

## 7) CTA (Call to Action)
- Primary: Choose 1 platform from Appendix A and ship your v1 page today.
- Secondary: Pick 1 MVP format and publish a paid beta by Friday.
- Engagement question: What outcome will your product deliver in 7 days?

## Appendix A — Platform Comparison (quick reference)

To get started, prioritize platforms that balance ease of use with robust features. For instance, Teachable stands out for its focus on creating an "online school" experience, allowing you to sell courses alongside digital downloads. Similarly, Kajabi integrates marketing automation, making it ideal for autopilot sales. When choosing, consider factors like transaction fees, customization options, and audience reach—marketplaces like Udemy offer built-in traffic but take a larger revenue cut, while self-hosted options like Podia give more control.

```
| Platform | Key Features | Pros | Cons | Pricing (Starting From) |
|----------|--------------|------|------|--------------------------|
| Udemy | Guided course creation, built-in audience | Easy for beginners, course review process | High revenue share (up to 63%), video required | Free for free courses; 3% on coupons |
| Teachable | AI features, marketing tools | Custom coding, scalable for schools | Limited templates | $29/month + 7.5% fee |
| Kajabi | Email marketing, AI generation | All-in-one marketing | Expensive, less customizable | $71/month |
| Podia | Simple builder, supports multiple products | Affordable, unlimited courses | Transaction fees on top | $33/month + 5% fee |
| Thinkific | Community tools, quizzes | Free plan available, strong for memberships | Some features paywalled | Free; paid from $36/month |
| Wix | Integrated apps, forums | Easy drag-and-drop, multilingual | Not specialized for courses | Free basic; premium from $16/month |
| Gumroad | Quick setup for downloads | Low fees for digital sales | Limited course hosting | Free + 10% fee |
| Etsy | Marketplace exposure | Ideal for templates/printables | High competition, not course-focused | Listing fees + 6.5% transaction |
```

## Appendix B — Digital Product Types (idea bank)

Beyond courses, diversify with complementary products to enhance monetization. Profitable options include ebooks (scalable expertise sharing), templates (e.g., content calendars), printables (planners), stock media (photos/videos), and memberships (exclusive communities). For example, pair a course with a downloadable workbook to increase perceived value.

| Digital Product Type | Examples | Profit Potential | Best Platforms |
|----------------------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Online Courses | Video series on content strategy | High (one-time or subscriptions) | Thinkific, Teachable |
| Ebooks/Audiobooks | Guides to social media growth | Medium (passive sales) | Amazon KDP, Gumroad |
| Templates/Tools | Resume builders, spreadsheets | High (low creation effort) | Etsy, Creative Market |
| Printables/Planners | Content calendars, trackers | Medium (niche appeal) | Etsy, Pinterest-linked shops |
| Memberships/Communities | Exclusive tips forums | Recurring (loyalty-driven) | Patreon, Discord via Podia |
| Stock Media | Photos, sound effects | Variable (royalty-based) | Shutterstock, Adobe Stock |
| AI Tools/SaaS | Custom content generators | High (scalable subscriptions) | OpenAI integrations, custom apps |
