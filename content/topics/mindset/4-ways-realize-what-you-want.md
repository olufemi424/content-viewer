# 4 Ways To Realize What You Want

## 1) Self‑Reflection
- Find a quiet place. Take 5–10 minutes.
- Ask: “What makes me happy?” “What do I like doing for a long time?”
- Write your answers in a small list. Simple words are fine.

## 2) Try New Things
- Test one small activity each week: a club, a class, a hobby, a short trip.
- Notice what feels fun and what does not. Both answers help.
- Keep the things that give you energy. Drop the rest.

## 3) Make a Small Picture of the Future
- Close your eyes. Picture your life in one year.
- Where are you? What are you doing? Who is with you?
- Turn that picture into 1–3 clear goals you can start this month.

## 4) Ask For Honest Feedback
- Talk to someone you trust: a friend, a parent, a teacher, a mentor.
- Ask: “What seems to fit me?” “What do you see me do well?”
- Listen. You do not have to agree with everything. Keep what helps.
